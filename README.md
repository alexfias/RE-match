# Renewable Matching Index (RMI)

This repository provides a framework to compute the Renewable Matching Index (RMI) for energy system models. The goal is to assess how well an energy model matches renewable generation with demand in both space and time. It builds upon and extends the adequacy indicators defined by ENTSO-E, such as loss of load duration, loss of load expectation, and energy not served.
